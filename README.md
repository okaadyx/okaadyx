## 🚀 About Me

**Ever wondered what happens when curiosity meets code?** 👨‍💻  
I turned a love for gadgets into building apps that fit in your pocket 📱

I’m a **BCA graduate** and a **Mobile & Full-Stack Developer** with a strong focus on building **real-world, production-ready applications**. I enjoy turning ideas into reliable, user-friendly products—especially on mobile.

Most of my time goes into crafting clean **React Native** interfaces, integrating APIs, and fine-tuning backend logic with **Node.js and Express**. I care deeply about **code quality**, **performance**, and **user experience**, and I enjoy the process of debugging, optimizing, and refining until things feel just right.

During my **internship at EPL Star**, I shipped **production-ready features** using **React Native with Tamagui**, integrated them with **Node + Express APIs**, and worked hands-on in real development workflows—from planning and implementation to testing and delivery.
